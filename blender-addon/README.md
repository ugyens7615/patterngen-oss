# PatternGen Importer (Blender add-on)

Imports a PatternGen export (the `scene_name_pattern_gen.zip` produced by
the app) into Blender as three emissive, alpha-blended image-sequence
planes — one each for **titles**, **patterns** and **dots**.

## Install

1. In Blender: **Edit → Preferences → Add-ons → Install…**, pick
   `patterngen_importer.py`, then tick the checkbox to enable it.
2. Open the 3D Viewport's **N-panel** and find the **PatternGen** tab.

Tested on Blender 3.4 and Blender 4.x.

## Export your scene from the app first

1. In PatternGen, click **EXPORT**. You'll get
   `<sceneName>_pattern_gen.zip`.
2. Unzip it — you should see three subfolders:
   ```
   <sceneName>_pattern_gen/
     titles/
     patterns/
     dots/
   ```

## Import into Blender

1. In the **PatternGen** tab, set **Scene Folder** to the unzipped
   folder (the one that contains `titles/`, `patterns/`, `dots/`).
2. Click **Import Scene Folders**.

Three planes are created at the origin:

| Layer     | Cyclic | Location (m)   | Rotation         | Scale       |
| --------- | ------ | -------------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| titles    | off    | (0, 0, 0)      | 90° on X         | 6 × 6 × 6   |
| patterns  | off    | (0, 0.1, 0)    | 90° on X         | 6 × 6 × 6   |
| dots      | **on** | (0, 0.2, 0)    | 90° on X         | 6 × 6 × 6   |

Each plane gets a material with these nodes:

```
Image Texture (SEQUENCE, auto-refresh on)
  Color ─┬─► Principled BSDF › Base Color
         └─► Principled BSDF › Emission Color (strength = 1)
  Alpha ───► Principled BSDF › Alpha
```

Image sequence settings applied to every layer:

- **Start Frame** — `0`
- **Frames** — number of PNGs found in the folder
- **Offset** — `0`
- **Auto Refresh** — on
- **Cyclic** — on for `dots`, off for `titles` and `patterns`

The plane mesh itself is stretched to the image's aspect ratio
(16 : 9 for PatternGen exports), so the object scale stays uniform.

## Sync Start Frame across selected planes

1. Select the plane(s) you want to nudge (usually all three: click one,
   then `Shift`-click the others, or press `A` to select all).
2. In the **Sync Start Frame** section of the panel, type the new
   timeline **Start Frame** value.
3. Click **Apply to Selected**. Every image-sequence texture on the
   selected meshes is updated at once.

The status line shows how many sequences are about to be affected so you
know what you're pointing at before clicking.

## Notes

- The add-on creates materials with `blend_method = 'BLEND'` so that the
  alpha channel renders cleanly in Eevee / Cycles. If you see
  sort-order artifacts, switch individual materials to `HASHED`.
- Re-importing into the same scene does not delete old planes — Blender
  will just suffix new objects with `.001`, `.002`, etc. Delete the
  old group manually if you want a clean re-import.
- The 0.1 m spacing between layers is just there to avoid z-fighting.
  Move the planes along any axis that fits your camera setup.
